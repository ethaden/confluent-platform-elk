= Demo for sending Confluent Platform logs to ELK

This demo show how to send log files to ELK (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana).

== Preconditions

Adapt the testbench to your version of Confluent Platform as required by modifying `.env`.

== Running Confluent Platform

Start the containers by running:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Stopping the containers without removing any volumes:
```
docker compose down
```

Stopping the containers with removal of all created volumes (be careful!):
```
docker compose down -v
```

Cleaning up (CAREFUL: THIS WILL DELETE ALL UNUSED VOLUMES):
```
docker volumes prune
```

* URL: `http://localhost:5601`
* Username: `elastic`
* Password: `elastic`
